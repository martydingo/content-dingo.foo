# Oxidized

A contribution, in which a pull request was submitted and merged for the support of harvesting configurations from Cambium ePMP devices, in which the PR can be found [here](https://github.com/ytti/oxidized/pull/2195).

As this is included with the standard release of [Oxidized](https://github.com/ytti/oxidized), the only required configuration is using the correct model name, which at this current point of time is `cambiumepmp`.

For more details, please see the [Configuration](https://github.com/ytti/oxidized/blob/master/docs/Configuration.md) wiki page on the Oxidized git repository.
